## Completion Instructions

### Functionality

#### Must Have
     
     Display Cities in a table:
    Show all cities in a table format with infinite scroll (use this API to get the city data: https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000/api/?disjunctive.cou_name_en&sort=name).
    The table should have columns for city name, country, timezone, etc.
    Implement search as you type for this table. Utilise an autocomplete feature to suggest possible locations as users type.
    Implement filter and sorting for each column
    Clicking on the city name should take you to the weather page for this city
    Right-click on the city name and opening in the new tab should also open the weather page for the city but in the new tab.


    Weather page:
    You can reach this page by clicking on the city name in the table section as mentioned in the previous section.
    Use https://openweathermap.org free API to display weather on this page

#### Nice to Have

    Utilize the preferred stack, such as Next.js for the frontend framework, MST (MobX State Tree) for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
    Implement geolocation to automatically detect and display the weather for the user's current location.
    Maintain history of viewed locations' weather.
    Provide options to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius/Fahrenheit, metric/imperial).
    Add a feature to save favourite locations for quick access.
